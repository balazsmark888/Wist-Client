Description
==

Wist is a relatively slow-pased card game, which can entertain up to six players at once.
There are eight times the number of players amount of cards in the game (the highest possible ones from the French deck).

Gameplay
==

A match consists of multiple rounds, which are as follows:
* n : 1
* 1 : 2, 1 : 3, 1 : 4, 1 : 5, 1 : 6, 1 : 7
* n : 8
* 1 : 7, 1 : 6, 1 : 5, 1 : 4, 1 : 3, 1 : 2
* n : 1

Where x : y means x rounds with y number of cards.

Rounds
======
In every round one of the players is the Dealer, who deals the cards. This role changes round by round, similarly to poker. After the dealer has dealt the required amount of cards, he/she flips the next card from the deck and places it on top of the deck (facing up); this card is the **tromph**.

  After the Dealer has finished his job, the Prediction Phase begins in which each player (starting from the player next to the dealer, ending with the dealer) predicts the number of hands that he/she will win in that round. The sum of the predictions cannot be equal to the number of cards in the round, that is, at least one of the players' prediction will be incorrect.
  
  Following the Prediction Phase, the Pick Phase is when players use their cards. The first hand starts with the player next to the dealer; he/she picks a card, and places it down on the table. Each player now (in order) picks a card and does the same. If a player has cards with the same color as the hand-starter card, they have to choose from those; if he/she doesn't have that color, but has the same color as the tromph, he/she has to pick from those ones. If not, it's a free choice.
  
  If there were tromph-colored cards played during the minor round, the player who played the highest tromph wins the hand.If there were no tromphs, the player who had the highest card with similar color to the hand-starter card wins it.
  
  The winner of the hand starts the next hand.

Scoring
======
After all the cards were played, those players who predicted correctly get 5 points plus the amount of hands they won in that round.
If somebody was incorrect, he/she loses the difference between his/her prediction and the amount of hands he/she won.
If somebody predicts correctly five times in a row, gets 10 extra points, but if somebody loses points five times in a row, loses 10 points.

One-carded rounds
======
In these rounds the players cannot look on their own card, instead, they see each other's. The gameplay is the similar: prediction, then picking your only card. For these rounds you don't get bonus points.

8-carded rounds
======
In these rounds the whole deck is dealt, so there is no tromph card.

Winning condition
====
By the end of the rounds, if somebody was able to get a total of 0 points, he/she is the winner; if not, the player(s) with the highest score are.
